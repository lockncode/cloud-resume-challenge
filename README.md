# Cloud Resume Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/), originally created by [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com/) and maintained since mid‑2025 by [Andrew Brown](https://exampro.co/) of ExamPro. The project demonstrates end‑to‑end deployment of a personal resume website using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, incorporating front‑end hosting, serverless back‑end functions, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD automation. It’s designed to help cloud engineers and learners build practical, production‑ready cloud skills through guided experimentation.

## How

Development took place in an isolated WSL2 virtual machine using Visual Studio Code.

## Why
After gaining hands-on experience with other hyperscalers like AWS and Azure, I was eager to explore Google Cloud Platform's capabilities.

## Components

- [Backend](./backend/README.md)
- [GCP](./gcp/README.md)

## Future considerations

- Rebuilding on Azure and AWS
- Implementing CI/CD
- Adding MODs recommended in the Cloud Resume Challenge Books
- Switching Frontend to Astro Framework
